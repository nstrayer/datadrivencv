# This script builds both the HTML and PDF versions of your CV

# If you want to speed up rendering for googlesheets driven CVs you can cache a
# version of your data This avoids having to fetch from google sheets twice and
# will speed up rendering. It will also make things nicer if you have a
# non-public sheet and want to take care of the authentication in an interactive
# mode.
# To use, simply uncomment the following lines and run them once.
# If you need to update your data delete the "ddcv_cache.rds" file and re-run

# source("CV_printing_functions.R")
# create_CV_object(
#   data_location = "{{{data_location}}}",
#   cache_data = TRUE
# )
